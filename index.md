I'm a postdoc studying evolutionary genetics at the University of Chicago.
I previously did a postdoc with Daniel Matute and Dan Schrider at UNC Chapel Hill, and I did my Ph.D. with Stephen Wright at the University of Toronto. Prior to that I worked in Jeff Ross-Ibarra's lab as an undergraduate at UC Davis.

I'm generally interested in how contingencies such as genome structure, demographic history, and life history transitions guide and constrain genome evolution, ultimately shaping genetic diversity and genetic load.
I'm also interested in how various aspects of genome structure themselves evolve, particularly the rate and landscape of recombination at fine- and coarse-scales.
I study these genomic traits and processes using a combination of empirical genomic data across a range of species, including several plant species and the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, as well as population genetic simulations.
