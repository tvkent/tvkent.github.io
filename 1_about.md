I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Stephen Wright](http://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca).
I started in 2015, working on my thesis on the evolution of mutation, selection, and recombination following major transitions in the Brassicaceae, as well as several projects involving introgression in the *Capsella* genus.  

I received my B.S. in Genetics and Genomics with a minor in Statistics from the University of California, Davis in 2015.
There I worked in the [Ross-Ibarra lab](http://www.rilab.org) contributing to research on genome size evolution, [scripts](https://github.com/mojaveazure/angsd-wrapper) to improve population genomic software, and crop-wild introgression in *Oryza*.
